Goals:
Receiver side
    MRCshield supporting:
      as many pwm ports as possible
      as many analog inputs with Circuitry for temperature sensing (Motor /ESC/Servos) as possible
      design manner to turn them into digital inputs by leaving the channel unpopulated or by means of a dip switch
      overal compact layout to fit on any arduino MKR
      complementary firmware
Sender Side
    MRCtx supporting:
    all channels supported by MRCshield
    display to show received values and states of channels
    easy means of pairing to MRC receiver
    physical versions for Pistol style and gimbal style(rc plane remote)
    Kit to put into existing RC controller shell?
    Fully standalone TX?
    Add on as bonus for existing RC systems(non intrusive)
    
 MRCextender
    Range extender
    Basically a WIFI repeater to get better signal coverage in the wild.
 MRCcheckpoint
  Device that registers contact with MRC-Vehicle and keeps track of score
  deploy data to whole system(players see score/leaderboard on the remote)
  
 virtual Games playable with physical RC-Vehicles(ideas):
    
    King of the Hill ( the last to control the checkpoint adfter time runs out wins)
    Domination ( keep control of checkpoints as a team)
    Baja (pass all checkpoints as fast as possible)
